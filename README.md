# Flask-chat

Chat rooms project created with Flask and Flask_socketIO. The aim is to create a chat server using Python. Flask powers the backend and SocketIO is used to redirect users to different rooms. Front-end will also be worked on, aiming for an aesthetically-pleasing and friendly UI.

These issues are being worked on.
